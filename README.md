# Docupie

**`Docupie`** is an advanced document processing tool that leverages AI to extract structured data from PDFs. It is built to handle PDF conversions, extract relevant information, and format results as specified by customizable schemas.

## **Features**

- Extracts structured JSON output from unstructured documents.
- Converts documents into Markdown format.
- Supports custom schemas for data extraction.
- Includes pre-defined templates for common schemas.
- Works with OpenAI and custom LLM setups (Llava and Llama3.2-vision).
- Auto-generates schemas based on document content.

### Try the Hosted Version 🚀

The hosted version provides a seamless experience with fully managed APIs, so you can skip the setup and start extracting data right away. [Join the beta](https://documind.xyz/signup) to get access to the hosted service. 

In the meantime, you can explore the playground [here](https://www.documind.xyz/playground). Upload your documents and extract structured data with your own custom schema, or use one of the sample documents and template schemas.

## **Requirements**

Before using **`Docupie`**, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

### **System Dependencies**

- **Ghostscript**: **`Docupie`** relies on Ghostscript for handling certain PDF operations.
- **GraphicsMagick**: Required for image processing within document conversions.

Install both on your system before proceeding:

```bash
# On macOS
brew install ghostscript graphicsmagick

# On Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ghostscript graphicsmagick
```

### **Python**

Ensure Python 3.10.4+ is installed on your system.

## **Installation**

You can install **`Docupie`** via pip:

```bash
pip install Docupie
```

### **Environment Setup**

**`Docupie`** requires an **`.env`** file to store sensitive information like your OpenAI API key.

Create an **`.env`** file in your project directory and add the following:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## **Usage**

### **Basic Example**

First, import **`Docupie`** and define your schema. The schema outlines what information **`Docupie`** should look for in each document. Here's a quick setup to get started.

### **1. Define a Schema**

The schema is a list of dictionaries where each dictionary defines:

- **name**: Field name to extract.
- **type**: Data type (e.g., **`"string"`**, **`"number"`**, **`"array"`**, **`"object"`**).
- **description**: Description of the field.
- **children** (optional): For arrays and objects, define nested fields.

Example schema for a bank statement:

```python
schema = [
    {
        "name": "accountNumber",
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The account number of the bank statement."
    },
    {
        "name": "openingBalance",
        "type": "number",
        "description": "The opening balance of the account."
    },
    {
        "name": "transactions",
        "type": "array",
        "description": "List of transactions in the account.",
        "children": [
            {
                "name": "date",
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Transaction date."
            },
            {
                "name": "creditAmount",
                "type": "number",
                "description": "Credit Amount of the transaction."
            },
            {
                "name": "debitAmount",
                "type": "number",
                "description": "Debit Amount of the transaction."
            },
            {
                "name": "description",
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Transaction description."
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "closingBalance",
        "type": "number",
        "description": "The closing balance of the account."
    }
]
```

### **2. Run `Docupie`**

Use **`Docupie`** to process a PDF by passing the file URL and the schema.

```python
from docupie import extract

async def run_extraction():
    result = await extract(
        file="https://bank_statement.pdf",
        schema=schema
    )
    
    print("Extracted Data:", result)

# If using asyncio
import asyncio
asyncio.run(run_extraction())
```

### **Example Output**

Here’s an example of what the extracted result might look like:

```json
 {
  "success": true,
  "pages": 1,
  "data": {
    "accountNumber": "100002345",
    "openingBalance": 3200,
    "transactions": [
        {
        "date": "2021-05-12",
        "creditAmount": null,
        "debitAmount": 100,
        "description": "transfer to Tom" 
      },
      {
        "date": "2021-05-12",
        "creditAmount": 50,
        "debitAmount": null,
        "description": "For lunch the other day"
      },
      {
        "date": "2021-05-13",
        "creditAmount": 20,
        "debitAmount": null,
        "description": "Refund for voucher"
      },
      {
        "date": "2021-05-13",
        "creditAmount": null,
        "debitAmount": 750,
        "description": "May's rent"
      }
    ],
    "closingBalance": 2420
  },
  "fileName": "bank_statement.pdf"
}

```

Read the [documentation](https://docs.documind.xyz/guides/schema-definition) for more on how to define schemas and and enable auto-generation.

### **Templates**

Docupie comes with built-in templates for extracting data from popular document types like invoices, bank statements, and more. These templates make it easier to get started without defining your own schema.

**List available templates**

You can list all available templates using the `list_templates` function.

```python
from Docupie import templates

available_templates = templates.list()
print(available_templates)  # Prints all available template names
```

**Use a template**

To use a template, simply pass its name to the `extract` function along with the file you want to extract data from. Here's an example:

```python
from Docupie import extract
import asyncio

async def run_extraction():
    result = await extract(
        file="https://bank_statement.pdf",
        template="bank_statement"
    )
    
    print("Extracted Data:", result)

asyncio.run(run_extraction())
```

Read the [templates documentation](https://docs.documind.xyz/templates/overview) for more details on templates and how to contribute yours.
